# hyper-controller

Monorepo for live-streaming control for a bunch of RPi QUTRC Robots (hexapods, omnibots, 6DOF-arms)

Current local IP of the Pi on the hexapod on the QUT network is `169.254.155.56`.
This is subject to change at any time the QUT dhcp server rolls over (although the network seems extremely large this year)
