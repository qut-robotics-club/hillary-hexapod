# hyper-controller

Monorepo for live-streaming control for a bunch of RPi QUTRC Robots (hexapods, omnibots, 6DOF-arms)

Current local IP of the Pi on the hexapod on the QUT network is `172.19.9.138`.
This is subject to change at any time the QUT dhcp server rolls over (although the network seems extremely large this year)

The password is currently `rustisthebest`

To connect to the pi wirelessly you can use the command:

```
ssh pi@
```
